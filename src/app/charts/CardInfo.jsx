Individuals can focus on skill development or pivot to industries with higher demand. Expanding social safety nets, like unemployment benefits, can also help sustain affected workers during economic recovery.";
  const gdpNext = "When GDP is increasing, consider investing in growth sectors and inflation-resistant assets. Review any planned borrowing, as interest rates might rise, and focus on savings to preserve purchasing power. Businesses could take advantage of the growth to expand, while individuals should prepare for potential inflation and future economic cycles.";
  const interestRateNext = "When interest rates are rising, borrowing costs increase, which can slow economic growth. Consider reducing high-interest debt, locking in fixed-rate loans, and focusing on investments that perform well in higher-rate environments, like bonds with short durations. For businesses, higher rates mean higher financing costs, so efficient cash flow management becomes critical. For individuals, itâ€™s wise to prioritize saving, as higher rates can increase returns on savings accounts and fixed-income investments."
  const cpiNext = "A rising CPI indicates increasing prices, while a declining CPI suggests deflation. When CPI is increasing, it reflects inflation, which can erode purchasing power. Consider investing in assets that typically hedge against inflation, such as real estate or commodities, and review your budget to account for rising costs. For businesses, higher inflation may increase input costs, necessitating price adjustments or cost-saving measures. Individuals should prioritize maintaining the real value of savings and income by focusing on inflation-protected financial instruments."
