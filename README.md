# Welcome to Shawn's Projects!

This site is for some of my personal projects. Right now, this includes:
1. A <a href="/macro-dashboard" target="_blank">United States Macroeconomic Dashboard</a>
2. An <a href="/algo-trader" target="_blank">algorithmic trader</a> (availabled to a limited audience)
2. And a <a href="/health-tracker" target="_blank">health tracker</a> (availabled to a limited audience)

To run this project, you'll need all the env secrets. You can then spin up a local server using:
```bash
npm run dev
```
